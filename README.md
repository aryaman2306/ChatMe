# ChatMe
In This Repository i Have Displayed a basic python chat application i will keep it updated 

it has 2 sections 
server.py and client.py

For GUI part i used the "Tkinter" library 
To establish Connection i used the "socket" library

NOTE: this example only works on the same machine (localhost) and is not suitable for deployment over the internet without further adjustments. Additionally, this is a basic example without any error handling, security, or user interface enhancements. In a real-world application, you would need to add these features to make it robust and secure.
